      `The holy Baal Shem Tov was walking down the path away from the Mikveh where he just immersed himself, and a bunch of hooligans were coming against him. And he didn't want them to touch him so that he shouldn't have to immerse himself again, and then he heard them say "let's stay away from that dirty Jew" - and they moved aside.
                  Said the holy Baal Shem Tov: הֶן עָם לְבָדָד יִשְׁכֹּן – Sometimes in order for this עם to remain בודד - isolated so that they can experience their purity and their connection to Hashem – וּבַגּוֹיִם לֹא יִתְחַשָּׁב – we need גויים to say "I'm not מחשב you, dirty Jew".
                  There's a bright side to anti-Semitism; they let us be, so that we could be that which we are – Hashem's nation… Today. ` +

                  And the Sfas Emes wonders why in the world would you want to take what Bilaam said and put it into Krias Shema? The secret is - says the Sfas Emes - no matter what happens, even if somebody wants to curse you, even if there’s obstacles in your life, even if you meet your “Bilaam” know that at the end of the day it’s all from Hashem, and anything that happens is only here in order to connect you to Hashem. 
                  And when you realize that, you know what happens to all those curses in your life? Wow, it turns into the greatest blessing ever found… Today. ` +

                  And Rabbeinu Bechayai wonders: Why didn't he just stop and say "Hey, what's going on here?" And the answer is that when you want something, your mind works overtime and it carries you away and doesn't allow you to notice what's going on.
                  The message of Bilaam is one thing: Everything that's going on around you is amazing, it's communications from above. But you have to shut up and listen… Today.
