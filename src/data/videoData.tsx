      "It has to be that everything Hashem tells us about going out of Egypt, is talking about your life today. So what does it mean in your life that Hashem said to hit the water and it turned into blood?\n\nIf you look into the psukim, it first describes in great length how Moshe Rabbeinu comes to the yidden and he tries to give them chizuk. He said, ‘I had a vision, I want to tell you that there’s ד’ לשונות של גאולה, there's zchus avos…’ but sometimes, you can give chizuk and talk and talk, but nobody listens because their brain is elsewhere. That’s called apathy, being indifferent. \n\nHere there’s a new chidush. Hashem said, ‘I have a different technique, it's called makos. I will take water, I’m gonna take your ‘coldness’, your apathy, your indifference, and I’m gonna transform it into blood - into חיות - as it says, כִּי הַדָּם הוּא הַנָּפֶשׁ - “for the blood is the soul”. \n\nAll we need from you is to have a little חיות, and once you have that חיות - everything is possible because you’re alive, it makes a difference to you. That’s the blessing of מכת דם… 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth. Collecting anecdotes, sayings and Divrei Torah from Chabad, Breslav and other Hasidic masters and Rebbes.

      "On Ben Peles had a good wife, but what did she tell him to make him change his mind about joining the machlokes?  \n\nSaid R’ Itzikel Vurker: If you look into Rashi you see that she said “When people become powerful and wealthy, when they rise to the top, their mind changes. You think that’s the same person you knew before and that he’ll have הכרת הטוב and reward you for the help that you gave them in the past. It doesn’t work that way… \n\nWhat beef do you have in this machlokes? If Aharon will be the Kohen, you’ll be his talmid; If Korach will be the Kohen, you’re also going to be his talmid. But no one is ever going to take you with them to the top; their brain changes!”\n\nPower corrupts.

It’s a very logical question, everything you could ever want is included in the Sefer Torah, so why would you need a mezuzah that only has two parshios?\n\nSays the Lubavitcher Rebbe: Because the parshios in that mezuzah are talking about Ahava and Yirah, and without emotional experience then the Torah doesn’t fly up to heaven, it stays down here below… \n\nIf you want the Torah to remain alive, make sure to keep that mezuzah.

It’s something you have to do! What could be better in order to experience וְאָהַבְתָּ לְרֵעֲךָ כָּמוךָ then going around and helping yidden?\n\nThis talmid chacham later said that this opened up for him a new way of thinking. He realized that it’s not about saying, it’s about doing. 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

You are a stranger, you’re in a foreign land. A yid has to know “I’m a Jew, I’m an Eretz Yisroel Yid. I’m not an American, I’m not an Egyptian, I’m not from Midyon. I belong to Hashem.”\n\nAnd once you have that base, all of a sudden you start realizing how Hashem is always with you and how He is always saving you. 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

And Avraham said, "No, but you laughed."\n\nThe angel asks Avraham: “Why did Sarah laugh?” Sarah was afraid and she denied it, saying “I did not laugh.” And Avraham told her “You did laugh.”\n\nAnd we all wonder: Did Sarah lie? How can it be?\n\nWe all know that sometimes we mess up in life, and when you want to do Teshuvah, it depends on how you do it. Sometimes we do Teshuvah because we’re afraid, and Chazal tell us that it becomes כשגגה - as if we didn’t do it on purpose. \n\nBut sometimes we do Teshuvah from love, we accept that we did something wrong, and we’re here to listen to what it can teach us. And then you look back and say, wow! I’m really glad that I messed up because I wouldn\'t have gotten to a higher place without it.\n\nSaid the Holy Sfas Emes: You know why Sarah said that she didn\'t lie? וַתְּכַחֵשׁ שָׂרָה...כִּי יָרֵאָה - Because she already did Teshuvah מיראה, so it\'s a clean slate. יֹּאמֶר לֹא כִּי צָחָקְתְּ - But Avraham said: No! I need you to take it to an even higher level and do Teshuva מאהבה. Say “I did laugh! I did mess up! But what could it teach me?”\n\nAnd when she did, she suddenly realized that her laughter was the best thing that ever happened to her. And eventually, she gave birth to Yitzchak who was מתקן that laughter. 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

Recently a man came to me and was crying \"My wife is not there for me, what should I do?\" \n\nSo I call over his wife, and she says \"Of course not, he's not there for me, he doesn't take care of my family, he doesn't provide for my children to eat; why should I be there for him?\" \n\nSo I said to the husband \"You're going to start providing for your wife, and then she'll be there for you.\" And they went home happy.\n\nAnd now when I went to the Mikveh I saw that a difficult year is coming, there's not going to be Parnoseh. So I said \"Hashem, I'm not going into this Mikveh, I'm not going to be available for you.

Both got punished, but the king said \"treat the high ranking official with respect, make sure he doesn't get humiliated.\"\n\nAnd then a few days go by, and the king hears how the high ranking official is bragging to that lowly servant \"you see, I'm better then you.\" And the king makes him get punished on the lowest level possible.\n\nSaid the holy Baal Shem Tov: There's a מכה that's כתובה בתורה – that's when you learn the psukim of the Torah and you take musser upon yourself, and you chastise yourself. But that's only as long as you're not haughty, that's only as long as you don't brag and you think you're better than anybody else, and you know Torah.\n\nBut when you do, you get a מכה אשר לא כתובה בתורה and you start suffering the way simple people do. Let's always remember: We're all the same, and if we have the gift of knowing Torah, it's just a way of how we can become even more humble and connect to Hashem… Today.\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

You had to become your own melamed. And once upon a time there was a father, and he took his child and he became his melamed.\n\nAnd you know when a child wasn't learning, out came the belt. So this father-turned-melamed is siting with this child and the child doesn't know the learning, and he starts hitting him. And the child cries \"Tatte, Tatte, stop hitting me!\" And the father says \"No, now I'm not your father, now I'm your teacher and you got to learn.\"\n\nAnd the next day the same thing happens again and again, until one day the child has a brainstorm. After they finished learning and they're walking home, he says \"Tatte, are you my father now, or my teacher?\" So the father says \"Now I'm your father.\" Says the child: \"Tatte, tomorrow when you're going to become my melamed, make sure he doesn’t hit me. Tatty, can you speak to my rabbi that he doesn't hit me again?\"\n\nSo when we sit there with the Melech Basadeh, that's the time when we experience that \"my father is really my king\". And then we can say: Tatte, Tatte, when you're going to be my king, could you make sure that I experience your love then too… Today.\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      'The entire Parshas Shoftim is talking about appointing judges and appointing a king, and the Torah warns us to make sure that he doesn\'t take bribery.\n\nThe Chassidic masters taught: The greatest bribery a person faces is self-bribery, because you rationalize your way through problems. And it\'s extremely difficult for a person to be truthful and honest and really know where he has to go.\n\nYou have to have a higher power above you, where you can be Mevatel yourself, to guide you to take you where you need to go. But the question always is "How do you find them?"\n\nThe holy Maggid was once approached by a few people from Lithuania, and they said "Rebbe, we really want to connect to you but you\'re too far. Give us somebody local." And he gave them his "shupitza" – some type of a bekisheh, and he said "Go to Vitebsk and give it to Reb Mendel."\n\nThey went until they found Reb Mendel, and that was Reb Mendele Vitebsker. He was part of a chabura – a group of people how used to learn and study Torah. When they told him that the Maggid called for him, he suddenly got up, and they told him "You are going to be the Rebbe" and he refused.\n\nBut then they gave him that "shupitza" and suddenly when he put it on he transformed and turned into a Rebbe, and a tremendous awe befell upon all his previous friends, and now they had a mentor – someone above them.\n\nThe secret is: Every person has to realize that he can be your friend, he can be somebody you trust and you know is out there to help you.

      'One of the greatest weddings of all time in the Chassidic legends and lore, was the Chatina Chasuna. \n\nAnd the holy Rebbe of Sadiger, a son of the Riziner, attended that wedding. But it was fraught with tremendous danger, because there were outlaws. They escaped into Austria and they weren\'t allowed back into Russia, but he attended anyway.\n\nAnd when the Russian government found out, they sent a subpoena, to make sure that they catch him and keep him within the Russian borders in order to bring him to justice. And as he got closer to the border, many Chassidim went to the Poritz who was the land-owner in that region, and they convinced him to let him go through.\n\nAnd when the Poritz heard this whole commotion about this Rabiner that was coming, he decided that he wants to see what everybody is talking about. So as the Rebbes carriage is passing by, him and his wife went up on top of a porch and they were looking down. \n\nAnd when they saw the Rebbe passing in the carriage and they saw his Hadras Panim, his wife said "wow, he really looks like a holy man, but where is his bible?" She was used to seeing that priests are carrying the bible. Said the Poritz: "this Rabiner doesn’t need a bible, because he himself is the bible." \n\nAnd when this story was repeated to the holy Sadigerer, he said "that\'s what the pasuk says: וְקָרָא בוֹ כָּל יְמֵי חַיָּיו – the king has to write a Sefer Torah, וְקָרָא בוֹ – and you have to be able to see him and say that he is the bible…" Today.\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      "The Ruzhier brings this amazing story: \n\nThere were two brothers that got an inheritance, unfortunately they got into a fight, they were fighting over the money and they stopped talking to each other.\n\nA few years go by and one of the brothers makes a shidduch, and he desperately wants his brother to come to the chasuna, he doesn't want to go through that embarrassment that the family is split apart. And he sends a shliach to his brother \"let's make peace, let's work it out,\" but the brother doesn't want to talk to him.\n\nThe day of the chasuna comes, and he goes himself to his brother and he says \"dear brother please let's make shalom, there's a simcha happening let's bring our hearts together,\" but his brother doesn't even want to look at him.\n\nSo without a choice the chasuna begins, and the whole town is out there in the courtyard and the chasuna is going strong. And the brother that didn't want to come couldn't stand the music, so he gets into his pajamas and takes his pillow and puts it over his head and tries to drown out the music.\n\nAnd the chasuna is going stronger and stronger and the joy is increasing more and more, and then suddenly in the middle of the joy at night one of the musicians goes over to the mechtan and says \"I have a deal for you, if you give me some really good mashkeh I promise you that your brother is going to be here.\"\n\nSo of course he brings him the best mashkeh that he has and he makes a few Lechaim's, and then he takes out his flute, and from the depths of his soul a song comes forth that was never heard before that reaches to the deepest recesses of everyone's heart. And suddenly the joy is going to the next level and the brother with his pillow over his head can't control himself anymore and he jumps out of bed in his underwear. And he runs into the chasuna and he starts dancing and the brother hugs him, and everybody is \"WOW\".  \n\nBut the brother tells him afterwards \"Achi, if you wouldn't have waited so long, you wouldn't have had to come in with you underwear. If you would have come just a bit earlier, you could have come wearing your pants too.\" \n\nSaid the holy Chasidic master the Ohev Yisrael:  וְהָיָה עֵקֶב – In the end, תִּשְׁמְעוּן – You are going to listen, Hashem is going to get through to you.

And the holy Me'or Einayim writes that whoever has a mind's eye can see very vividly that someone who doesn't want to give tzedakah – his money is 'masriach mamesh'. It stinks, and it's only through giving tzedakah that that's the salt that preserves it. \n\nThe holy Me'or Einayim was a great pauper, and one day somebody came to him and he cried \"Rebbe, I don't have any money to marry off my daughter\" So of course he gives everything away.\n\nAnd later the Me'or Einayim's rebbetzin sees that he's in the kretchme - in the bar, and this guy is using the money to buy himself whiskey. And she comes home and she can't take it, \"we don't even have bread at home, and here he's using the money for whiskey!\"\n\nThe Me'or Einayim said \"Oy, if I would have known that he needed whiskey I would have given him money for that too.\" \n\nThat's the way Tzaddikim viewed the privilege to be able to give tzedakah… Today.\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      "Hashem says: וחי בהם – My Torah is something you're going to live from, ולא שימות בהם. But on the other hand - זאת התורה אדם כי ימות באהל, and Chazal say אין התורה מתקיימת – the Torah is only going to remain - אלא במי שממית עצמו עליה – for somebody who dies for it. And the holy Chofetz Chaim says: \"How does that work?\" \n\nOnce upon a time there was a merchant and as he got older he decided one day \"What am I working for? What am I living for? A whole day I'm only running after money.\" And he decides he's going to give away two hours a day, and all he's going to do is connect to Hashem and sit and learn, and that's what he did. \n\nAnd the first day, the second day, and the third day goes by, and then his wife notices that the store is full of customers and nobody is attending to them. And she runs to her husband and says \"What's going on? Are you crazy? And he says \"Listen, if the מלאך המוות would come and just give me two more hours to live, what would you say then? Would you grant those two hours for me to connect to Hashem?\n\nAnd that's the secret. When you live your life knowing that you only have today and you might drop dead, then suddenly וחי בהם – you start living; you start realizing that it's only today that I have to live.

      "You all know what happened to Korach, right? He ended up swallowed somewhere deep down under. But that's not the end of the story. Right afterward there's this strange story where everyone gives in their fancy wooden stick known as a staff, and Hashem says וְהָיָה הָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר אֶבְחַר בּוֹ מַטֵּהוּ יִפְרָח - “The staff of the man whom I will choose - will blossom” (Bamidbar 17:20)\n\nThis is one of those interesting stories in the Torah we just gloss over. But why did we need a ‘choosing test’? When Korach died everyone knew that Aharon was the winner Kohen Gadol! \n\nPlus, if you do want to make a spectacular Kohen Gadol Winners Trophy Award, then why a blooming staff? Maybe a magical pair of Bigdei Kehuna could’ve come down from heaven straight to Aharon Hakohen?\n\nSo here's the secret. Of course, The Yidden knew that Aharon Hakohen was the winner. But they wondered why? \"what's so special about Aharon HaKohen? Why is he better than the rest?” Said Hashem: Aharon has something that nobody else has. He's a people lover - he’s Mekarev Yidden! And you have no idea what amazing transformations ימין מקרבת can do. Like the holy Sfas Emes says Aharon was Yemin Mekareves - so even his wooden staff had ברכה ודביקות in it too.\n\nBut just so you can visualize it - let me show you. You know there are blooming trees - Ahhh they are full of life, colorful fruits, birds, and buzzing bees. But then there are cut off branches, they are turned into dead staffs – something lifeless that will never grow. Now watch, says Hashem, see with your own eyes what will happen when that dead Staff belongs to an ohev yisrael, suddenly it becomes alive! It becomes full of energy and vitality, and it gives birth to new fruit.\n\nI'm sure you have in your life people who are “staffs” – they hit you, they bother you, they're dead, they're just a hard stick. But give them some Aharon HaKohen ימין מקרבת - watch and they'll bloom too… 🔥\n\nTable Topics\n\nWhat types of behaviors that people do are your “staffs” that just get under your skin?\nHow was Aharon HaKohen able to love these people with such despicable actions?\nShare a story where someone was able to love a difficult person\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      'And so this beautiful couple comes to Reb Shimon Bar Yochay, and they cry that they have no children for ten years. And The Medresh Shir HaShirim Rabba tells us they came from Tzidon. \n\nAnd Reb Shimon Bar Yochay said "You didn’t have children for ten years, it’s time to let it go. But the way how you do it is that you have to make a feast with מאכל ומשתה and that’s how you should divorce and separate. \n\nSo they get together and they make this huge party, and the husband gets drunk and while he’s up there in the heavens he tells his wife "look around the house and take whatever you want and take it home to your father". \n\nand he drinks a little more until he’s not here anymore, and she tells the servants "take my husband, come" and she puts him to sleep in her father’s house, and when he wakes up in middle of the night he looks around and he says "where am I?" And she says "In my father’s house." He says מה לי לבית אביך – "what do I have with your father?" \n\nAnd she said "Didn’t you say that I can take whatever I want? There’s nothing more that I want then you." And they go back to Reb Shimon Bar Yochay and they tell him the story. And Reb Shimon Bar Yochay prayed for them, and the next year they had a child. \n\nAnd the Medresh continues, that if we ever want to connect to Reb Shimon Bar Yochay, the real message is that we tell Hashem "there’s nothing that I want besides you."\n\nAnd whenever we fall through, and sometimes we have to separate and we find ourselves in some bad places, we always have to remember that you can always ask for one thing, "Hashem, didn’t you say I can have anything? I want you." And when you go to that place where all I want is you Hashem, then suddenly new options open up.\n\nAnd Lag Baomer is a time of Miracles, and we have to say "Hashem Hashem, the fire is burning within me, that fire is you. It’s me, I want you." And then - wow, Lag Baomer turns on fire… Today.\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      "So right after we finish talking about all these creepy disgusting creatures, the Torah tells us that a woman is going to give birth and have a son. And Reb Akiva Eiger says: what’s the connection? Beware, do you want to have holy beautiful children? Then make sure that you feed yourself with holy food.\n\nAnd the secret is so evident and so deep, if you fill yourself up with positive energy and positive thoughts, you’ll produce something beautiful. But if you don’t, then don’t blame yourself when something disgusting comes out.\n\nMake sure you think positive and surround yourself with beautiful things and beautiful ideas… Today.  \n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      "When Hashem wants to get a message across with tough talk, it says וידבר. But when He’s soft-spoken, it says ויאמר.\n\nSays the holy Rebbe R’ Elimelech: What’s going on? In this week it starts off וַיְדַבֵּר אֱלֹקִים אֶל מֹשֶׁה וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו אֲנִי השם - Is it tough of soft-spoken??\n\nThere’s an unbelievably deep secret here: many times in life you hear people say “He never said he loved me. But he still loved me” because there’s what you say, and then there’s what you actually mean. Not everybody can express it.\n\nWhen Moshe Rabbeinu came to Hashem and said לָמָה הֲרֵעֹתָה לָעָם הַזֶּה - “Why do You mistreat Your people?” (Shemos 5:22). It sounds like he’s blaming Hashem, so Hashem responds right away with tough talk, וַיְדַבֵּר אֱלֹקִים - ‘you don’t talk that way!’ \n\nBut then Hashem speaks to him softly, saying וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו - Moishe’le, Moishe’le, I know the truth. You’re not blaming me, you’re only talking that way because you care about My yiddelech; and that’s why you’re Moshe Rabbeinu, that is why you are going to lead them out of mitzrayim. \n\nDon't waste your life waiting for people to say they love you, they are saying it already. Just in different words. Learning the art of translating what people mean to tell you, can make you experience a loving caring world!  🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

And Chazal say: How are you going to get through difficulties?

What am I supposed to do?”  \n\nSays the Midrash: Hashem told Dovid HaMelech “You got it. As long as a Yiddele is going to take out a Tehillim and say those ancient words, it’s as if he learnt נגעים ואהלות. \n\nוְאֵלֶּה שְׁמוֹת בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל הַבָּאִים מִצְרָיְמָה אֵת יַעֲקֹב אִישׁ וּבֵיתוֹ - Is סופי תיבות Tehillim and Teshuva.\n\nYou can do Teshuva and you can say Tehillim to!

      "They were high-ranking Egyptian officials, they had good jobs, and suddenly they’re thrust into a pit and they’re probably eating dog food. So why is Yosef asking them  מַדּוּעַ פְּנֵיכֶם רָעִים הַיּוֹם - Why are you so down? Why the long face?\n    \nSaid R’ Mota Frank: Yosef HaTzadik had a way of carrying his inner peace and happiness, that he was able to spread it wherever he was. Regardless of how long he was in prison, he managed to spread his wellness and happiness to others, to the extent that when somebody was sad, it was something out of the ordinary.\n\nSo he asked them מַדּוּעַ פְּנֵיכֶם רָעִים הַיּוֹם - Why are you so sad? Find ways how you can focus on today. הַיּוֹם is roshei teivos הָסֵר מִמֶּנּוּ יָגוֹן וַאֲנָחָה, live in the moment and you’ll remove from yourselves grief and sadness. \n\nIt's this inner peace and happiness that we have to search for in our lives, and find how to take it along with us.   #Today",

      "This yiddele came to R’ Shlom’ke Zhviller and he said: “Rebbe, I can’t bear the problems anymore, it’s too much!” Said R’ Shlom’ke: Let me tell you a secret. When you go collecting in shul, whatever amount of change a person asks you - that’s how much you know that you’ll be getting. \n\nWhen someone asks you for 50 cents, you know that he’ll be giving you a dollar, but when he asks you for 50 dollars, you know that a 100 dollar bill is on the way. When Hashem gives us a problem, it’s because he wants to give us something much better. When he gives us a big problem, then we know that something amazing is about to happen... 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

Why couldn’t he do it in the city? \n\nRabbi Nachman explains: you know what caused the yiddelech to go down to mitzrayim? When Avraham Avinu said בַּמָּה אֵדַע כִּי אִירָשֶׁנָּה - 'How can I really know that it will be mine?' (Bereishis 15:8)\n\nWhen a person asks ‘how will I know that it’s going to work?’ it’s because he sees that there’s a system with rules and according to that system it doesn't make sense.\n\nSo Moshe Rabbeinu said to Pharaoh, ‘you know how I leave Mitzrayim?’ כְּצֵאתִי אֶת הָעִיר - When I leave the city, when I leave the box and find myself alone in the fields and forests connected to G-d… 🌳🌲\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      "A Yiddele came to the Sanzer Rebbe and said “Rebbe, I don’t have money to marry off my daughters, what can I do?” The Sanzer Rav gave him some money and wrote him a letter, and he told him “show this letter to the rabbi of this town and he’ll help you.”\n\nThe Yiddele comes to the rabbi of that town and he knocks on the door, and the rabbi says “I’m sorry, I’m in the middle of learning right now and I have to go daven soon, I just don’t have any time.”\n\nThe Yiddele runs back to the Sanzer Rav despondent, so the Sanzer Rav rolls up his sleeves and starts knocking on doors, and he gives him what he needs to marry off his daughters.\n\nA while later this rabbi comes to visit the Sanzer Rav, and he sees that the Sanzer Rav is ignoring him, he wouldn’t even shake his hand. So the rabbi said “Rebbe, what did I do? Why are you ignoring me?”\n\nThe Sanzer Rav looks up to heaven and says: There are two times in the Torah where is says איש but it really means an angle. One time it says וַיֵּאָבֵק אִישׁ עִמּוֹ and it’s referring to שרו של עשו, and the other time it says וַיִּמְצָאֵהוּ אִישׁ וְהִנֵּה תֹעֶה בַּשָּׂדֶה and it’s referring to מלאך גבריאל. \n\nWhen do we know when איש means שרו של עשו and when it’s מלאך גבריאל? It depends. If when a Jew asks you בֵּרַכְתָּנִי - “Give me a blessing, help me” you tell him שַׁלְּחֵנִי כִּי עָלָה הַשָּׁחַר - “I’m sorry, I have to go pray now, I can’t help you.” then you know that it’s שרו של עשו. \n\nBut if when you find him he asks you מַה תְּבַקֵּשׁ - How can I help you? What can I do for you? Then you know that it's מלאך גבריאל.   #Today\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

I sacrificed myself and went to listen to Hashem and because of that my wife dies?”\n\nAnd Avraham realized that these thoughts are going south, so he dropped the Hesped and changed the conversation and started talking to the B’nei Cheis. And that’s the ultimate secret that when a person finds himself that his thoughts are going to veer south, cut and move on to a beautiful future… Today.",

      "Everybody knows the story of this guy who was grasping and begging in the storm “please G-d save me!” and he drowned. He comes up to heaven and G-d said “I sent you a boat!” And he said “but I didn't ask for a boat, I wanted you to save me.”\n\nHe didn't realize that that's how G-d saves you, he sends you a תיבה. And all of the Tzaddikim reveal that that תיבה is a word. Which words? \n\nThere's the word of Torah and the word of Tefillah, but always remember - taught Reb Nachman and all the Tzaddikim - there’s the power of your own words of communicating to Hashem, whatever your going through, whatever is going on in your heart, in your soul, in your mind, in your struggles, and in your emotions.\n\nAnd when you discuss with Hashem whatever is going on using your words - that becomes your תיבה. And that becomes וַיָּבֹא נֹחַ - you come to a place of Menucha, a place of serenity, אֶל הַתֵּבָה - within those holy words that you make with Hashem.\n\nLet's do it!... Today.\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel - https://goo.gl/Gaxm1v\nLike our Facebook page - https://goo.gl/gcJIJV",

Come into a structure. Come into a place where every single day you daven at the same time Tefillah BeTzibur. Come into a place where you have Shiurei Torah and you have words of Torah to create for you that boundary, that safety zone, that makes a box.\n\nAnd then, once you have that structure you can always look up to the Tzohar and allow light to shine in and create a warm safe zone that will keep you afloat above all of the raging waters of your life, and bring you to safety, to a place of meaning and inspiration… Today.",

Moshe Rabeinu is begging his whole life to go to Eretz Yisrael, and finally he’s begging and he makes all these prayers, and Hashem says you can’t go, but עלה ראש הפסגה – I’m going to let you go on top of the mountain and you could see Eretz Yisrael. \n\nIt’s like you’re taunting him, it’s like you’re telling him “I can’t give it to you, but I’m going to let you see it”.

But that’s what Moshe Rabeinu did.\n\nSays the אור החיים הקדוש, for forty years he kept the Mussar he wanted the Yidden to hear bottled up, until they got מעבר לירדן, why? And the אור החיים teaches us one of the most amazing secrets of effective communication; and listen good, “Knowledge is knowing what to say, wisdom is knowing when to say it” \n\nAnd Moshe Rabeinu - the wisest of the wise, he knew that if the Yidden are going to accept what he’s going to say, he has to find the right time to say it. And he knew that if they weren’t in their right place and they were yearning to go somewhere else, and their souls were depressed and they weren’t in a situation where they felt comfortable with themselves, there was no one to talk to. \n\nAnd he waited until the opportune time came up, because he knew that that’s when his message is going to penetrate and he’s going to take them to a place of improvement… Today. \n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      'As you focus in on the journey the Yidden took, you see that there are dots along the way. And then when you look into the שלחן ערוך, you see that when you read these מ"ב מסעות you have to read it in one continuous flow, you can’t stop in the middle. Why? Says the מגן אברהם, because it corresponds to the forty-two letters of the divine name.\n\nAnd here is the secret. Because whenever you have in your life certain destinations, certain struggles, suddenly you find yourself stuck in a certain position and you get aggravated and upset. And when you’re able to go to the top and look down and suddenly you say “wow, I have to connect these dots. This place I went through this struggle, this place of joy, this place of sadness, this place of aggravation, these were all dots that took me from מצרים to ארץ ישראל” \n\nAnd that’s the only way you can get to ארץ ישראל. But my life, that is just a compilation of dots that get me to a big picture. And when we read the Torah, it’s a time to reflect and ask Hashem – Please Hashem let me go to the top of the mountain, let me see down, let me look – עלה ראש הפסגה, and let me see the world from a different perspective, seeing my life as part of your divine plan, as one letter in your divine name… Today.\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      "The Torah is all about Shalom - peace. Asks Lubavitcher Rebbe: why in the world did we name the Parsha after Korach “Mr. Epitome of Divisiveness”, the person who comes to destroy Peace and achdus?\n\nThere’s a secret here. Today we know already that Kohanim are all about Shalom - Peace. But do you know how we figured that out? What drove us to discover that the inner meaning of כהונה must be all about Peace? Korach! He caused us to be in a place of divisiveness - that caused us to vow that Fighting is out - Shalom is in. Our appreciation for Peaceful Priests came through him!\n\nParshas ‘Korach’ isn't named after the person Korach. “Korach” is the name of a recurring situation. Whenever there are ulterior motives and power struggles - welcome to Korach. Every time we meet a Korach (or sometimes when we ourselves are a shtickle Korach), every time we’re in a place of divisiveness, realize that it’s only here to teach us a lesson - do whatever it takes to keep the Peace… 🔥\n\nTable Topics:\n\nIs there good that comes out of Machlokes?\nDo you think that “Korach situations” are getting better or worse in modern times?\nHow do you balance this Torah with the obligation to stand up for what you believe is right?

I need you to lift their heads upwards, I need them to walk tall and proud knowing that they’re someone, that they’re somebody, and that they’re unreputable.\n\nKnow that without you, Hashem’s world is not complete… 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      'And he would wander the Jerusalem alleyways helping the homeless, sometimes even feeding the cats, virtually unknown, living in a world of his own. He was known as Reb Shlomke Zhviller, and one of the practices he had was to go to the mikvah, and he would immerse himself hundreds of times and amazing things would happen. \n\nAnd one day, he’s in the mikvah in the morning and he’s toiveling himself, and this guy is waiting to go in, and he lashes out at him “What’s this craziness? Why are you doing this? You’re stuffing up the whole mikvah, you’re taking up so much space, Get out of here.”\n\nReb Shlomke comes out and he asks his gabbai – his attendant “who’s that guy who was just yelling?” The gabbai didn’t want to say, he was afraid maybe the Tzaddik was going to be angry and something bad might happen to him. \n\nReb Shlomke insisted, he said “Who was that guy?” Finally he tells him. He quickly ran over to this guy’s house, he pulls out all the money he has and pushes it under the door. A day later he meets the same guy, and he says “Rebbi, Rebbi, wow, Shalom Aleichem, so good to see you." And Reb Shlomke tells the attendant a bit later, he says “You see, when a Jew is in pain he starts yelling." \n\nThe next time somebody yells at us, screams at us, somebody is mad at us, realize he’s not mad at you, he’s just in pain, and we just need to reach that root of pain and help him heal it together… Today. \n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

      "So there are these walls separating each one of the שבטים as they're traveling thru the ים סוף. But what were these walls made out of? Tells the Medrash: They were made out of transparent water as clear as glass.\n\nBut if they're walls why do they have to be transparent? Said Reb Binyamin Hatzaddik from The Mir: Although everybody goes on their own path, and you have your way out to serve G-d, realize that in order for your way to take you to your destination you need a see-through wall. \n\nAnd realize that the other person going through his destination is going to get to the same place you are.\n\nAnd that's what unites us, realizing that even though each one has their own way of how to serve Hashem, but you have to be able to see through that wall and realize that his way is also a way.\n\nAnd that's how we reach our destination, united, together...

And that's the biggest צרה - the biggest גלות. And when you experience joy within yourself, knowing that whatever is happening to you is in order to bring you to that place where the hand fits into the glove, and things fit and are comfortable with themselves, so then you're releasing and redeeming that G-dly energy.\n\nAnd every time you experience joy regardless of what's going on, then you are מתקן the צרה, you are מתקן the גלות.

People get to a place of Churban everything is destroyed, and there's no hope, and then there's that one flicker of hope where people say \"No, I'm going to try it anyway\". \n\nAnd every single Chanukah it comes around again, and when you're holding that light and you're about to light that candle, find within yourself that place that says \"No, I can't do it anymore\" and light up that inspiration that we have within us, that \"Yes, I'm going to do that again anyway, I'm going to try again anyway\".\n\nFocus on that flicker of hope that you have within your heart...

      "What's the difference between a Tzaddik and us? A Tzaddik has a certain technique - a certain way of thinking. Anything that happens in his life he sees that ultimately it is for his benefit, and it's the reason why G-d wanted him to be that way. \n\nYosef HaTzaddik comes out of the בור, you know what he changes? All he changes is that he cuts off his hair and he changes his clothing, but he himself remained the same. And you know how he did it? The holy Ishbitzer says וירצהו מן הבור - VaYirtzihu means Merutza, he came out satisfied from the בור, he came out thrilled with the experience.\n\nAnd that's the secret Tzaddikim have, and that's what they teach us. You're in a בור, you know who threw you into the בור? Pharaoh, but you know why he threw you into the בור? Because one day he's going to have to pull you out and he is going to use you for something you were never able to do without it.\n\nAnd that's the beauty of connecting to the Tzaddikim and learning these techniques. Let's connect to the wisest people in the world - our very own Tzaddikim...

      "It's very interesting, wouldn't you say that if somebody wins a fight he's called a winner? \n\nWhen Yakov Avinu wins a fight he's not called a winner which the Pasuk calls him a winner. The Pasuk says כי שרית עם אלקים ועם אנשים ותוכל, so he should have been called \"תוכל\" - the winner.\n\nInstead, he was given a name ישראל, which means the ones fighting. Why is he called a fighter when he was really the winner? And there's a tremendous inspiration and a secret for success in life, Yidishkait doesn't care if you won or lost, but it does care about one thing - did you give it all you got?\n\nYaakov Avinu gave it all he got, and he was named ישראל because that's the real winner. And every Yid until today, me and you and every Jew, is called ישראל for that reason. \n\nWe have within ourselves and our soul that power to give it all we got forever...

When I left home, I crossed the Jordan with only my staff, and now I have enough for two camps. (Bereishis 32:11)\r\n\nWhat should someone do when he finds himself in most lost place in the world, in a place where he can’t see a way out?\r\n\nHe should remember that Yaakov Avinu went through the same experience, he thought כִּי בְמַקְלִי עָבַרְתִּי אֶת הַיַּרְדֵּן - I went through so many yeridos, so many low points. I’ve been through so many situations where it seemed that there’s no way out. \r\n\nBut ultimately, you know where they took me? To the best place in the world. It took me much higher than I could ever reach on my own without those negative experiences. \r\n\nThe holy Sfas Emes said: קָטֹנְתִּי - Yaakov Avinu said ‘Hashem! You brought me to a place where I felt small and lowly and I fell through, but now I realize that this is also מִכֹּל הַחֲסָדִים וּמִכָּל הָאֱמֶת אֲשֶׁר עָשִׂיתָ אֶת עַבְדֶּךָ - this is also from the greatest kindness that You did with me.\r\n\nBecause at the end of the day, there is no such thing as no way out. Maybe I don’t know the way, but I know that You’ll take me out and bring me to a higher place.\r\n\nThat is the secret, that is the lesson for every Jew that finds himself lost in the weeds: So many Jews before you also got lost on the way, they also went through difficult situations But in the end, they connected to their inner Emuna, and wow… it took them to incredible new heights where they couldn’t have gotten to without it... 🔥",

The purpose is the travels, the purpose is the struggle. The purpose is how you got there, not where you got but how much effort did you put in towards getting there.\n\nAnd that's what we count, that's what's important... 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

You know how you become higher? By going lower. By reaching down to the people below you, the שפל ברך, reaching down to the people struggling. If you want to go higher to become a Kohen you already missed the criteria, you totally missed what a Kohen is all about.\n\nA Kohen is the one who goes higher but is reaching lower.  🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

So every day by שמונה עשרה we should say אלוקי ישראל.\r\n\r\nSo he answers that if you count the letters of אֱלֹקי אַבְרָהָם אֱלֹקי יִצְחָק וְאֱלֹקי יַעֲקֹב it comes out to 26 letters, and twenty-six is the gematria of the שם הוי׳ - the name of Hashem. So we don't want to add the name ישראל, because it would be one extra letter and it won't be Gematria the name of Hashem. \r\n\r\nNow, what does he mean by this? And that's what you always have to understand when you learn a Chassidish Sefer. You have to say \"So what's the message?\" And the answer is that every person has in himself an Eikev - a low part of himself. Eikev means a heel, so the name Yaakov means the lower part of your heel, and every single person has in himself that עקב part where he struggles.\r\n\r\nAnd when you stand before G-d, we're not interested in your ישראל - in your high parts, because it's not Gematria the name of Hashem - that doesn't touch G-d. You know how we connect to G-d? Through Yaakov, and that's the only way, that's the combination of how a person gets close to G-d, because when a person struggles and he says \"Wow, I'm struggling\" Then you know who you discover? You discover Hashem. Because you say \"Look G-d, I'm struggling, help me out.\" \r\n\r\nKing David said לוּלֵי ה' שֶׁהָיָה לָנוּ יֹאמַר נָא יִשְׂרָאֵל – If we wouldn't have to connect to G-d then we would say ישראל in the שמונה עשרה, but because we have to connect with Hashem, He taught us how to connect through our Eikev - through our Yaakov… 🔥\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.

Why did you steal the things that I need in order to exist? \n\nSo the doctor answers him, and he says the way the Ishbitzer says it, ומה שתמצא את אלהיך - Let's say you're going to find your gods, let's say you're going to beat me, let's say you're going to find all your negative habits, and you're going to get to eat whatever you want, לא יחיה - You're not going to get to live, it's just not going to be good for you.\n\nAnd the doctor says, הכר לך מה עמדי - Come see the way I see things, וקח לך - and take your life back, start living yourself.\n\nAnd that's the וקח לך - the holy Izhbitzer says - that the נשמה is always fighting and he always tells you, he says \"What are you looking for? Why are you fighting me?

      "Everything about this Parsha is about sheep. We talk about striped sheep, we talk about spotted sheep, and everything we talk about Yaakov Avinu is about his relationship to his sheep.\n\nAnd the Tzadikim taught us, that sheep represents תמימות, because a sheep listens to whatever you tell him just because you told him. And each of us has a sheep within us that's able to listen naturally, \n\nWhat do you do when you find yourself in difficult situations like Yaakov Avinu, when you want to do one thing but you end up in another, you're trying to run away from Eisav, but you end up landing by Lavan?\n\nSaid the Tzadikim, you always have that natural sheep in you, you always have that natural תמימות, so when you're trying and you're striving and you're struggling, and you see I'm stuck, you know what you keep yourself busy with? You keep yourself busy with your sheep, with your תמימות.\n\nLet's tune into our natural תמימות...

And when he would hear people starting to groan and to moan that it's been three days since I had a decent meal, he used to bend over and whisper to them \"you know there's a guy Zalman Chaikin, I know that his house is open, you can always find a warm meal by him\"\n\nAnd after Shul he'd say \"let me tell you, let me show you, let me take you along with me and I'll show you where to go\" And he would walk them to the Chaikin's house, his house, and the people would sit down and they would be surprised at this fellow beggar, who started serving and bringing out food in a house that wasn't his own. And he would just smile and say \"Don't worry I know Reb Chaikin, all he wants is that you should feel at home\".\n\nRabbi Shimon Semp, Rosh Yeshiva Talpios  inspires through bringing Jewish spiritual concepts, with Chassidic Torah teachings down to earth.
